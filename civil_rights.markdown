# Civil Rights

If you believe that you have been discriminated against because of your race, color, national origin, disability, age, sex or religion by a health care or human services provider (such as a hospital, nursing home, social service agency) or by a State or local government health or human services agency, you may file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). You may file a complaint for yourself or for someone else.
