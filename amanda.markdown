Greetings!

My name is Amanda Hubbard and I am an uninsured patient with an Implantable
Cardioverter Defibrillator manufactured by Medtronic.  I will have had my
ICD for 2 years as of November 18, 2012, and have been uninsured for about
20 months.  The ICD was placed for primary prevention of Sudden Cardiac
Arrest due to congenital Long-QT Syndrome.

My ICD came with a CareLink monitor, which is a bedside monitor that
downloads information from my device and sends it to Medtronic at regular
intervals.  Medtronic then takes my data, summarizes it, and forwards it to
my doctor's office via an online portal.  This allows my clinic to monitor
me remotely, see the status of my device, look for lead problems and rhythm
abnormalities, etc.

My clinic has a policy of removing patients from their arrhythmia
registries if they do not keep regular appointments, and I was uninsured
and could not pay, so I subsequently failed to keep my appointment
schedule.  For more than a year I simply assumed that my device was no
longer monitored and hoped that the internal device-checks on my ICD would
be enough to let me know if there was a problem with my device.

But in early August 2012 I started wondering what happened to my device
data if there was no clinic to receive it, and if my device was indeed
functioning properly, and so I performed a manual interrogation of my
device with my CareLink monitor and then sent this email to Medtronic via
the contact form on their website:

Their response was this:

I found this response blatantly misleading, and so shortly thereafter I
sent this email to Medtronic:

This exchange led to a phone conversation with Jaimie Mattson about the
reasons Medtronic won't release interrogation information directly to
patients.  And after a number of weeks, she finally sent me an email
outlining the supposed regulations which are prohibiting Medtronic from
allowing me, *the originator of the data*, to get direct access to my own
interrogation reports:

Obviously, I find this all incredibly frustrating and downright *wrong*.  I
want access to my own health data.  I want the same level of access to *my
private health information* as Medtronic is providing the clinics and
providers.  I want to be able to opt out of being data-mined by my own
device company.  I should not be treated like a lab-rat simply because I
have a heart condition which requires medical intervention.

Medtronic is not interested in helping me get direct access to my private
health information.  They continue to tell me to "go through a clinic."
But I see no reason that I should have to pay (or beg) a proxy to get
access to data which originates from inside my body, is collected by a
device I paid for and own, and which is integral to my life and death.

Right now I have no options.

I hope you can help.

Sincerely,

Amanda S. Hubbard
