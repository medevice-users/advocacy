Howdy!

I'm a type 1 diabetic patient, diagnosed shortly before my 22nd
birthday.  I was quickly guided towards the insulin pump as the golden
standard of therapy, only to learn I'm just likely to die of
side-effects from the treatment as the disease itself.

If I could access and control my pump, I could work around known
design flaws, such as incorrect calculations of insulin on board, as
well as better tailor my therapy to my lifestyle.
