Howdy!

I'm a type 1 diabetic patient, diagnosed shortly before my 22nd
birthday.  I was quickly guided towards the insulin pump as the golden
standard of therapy, only to learn I'm just likely to die of
side-effects from the treatment as the disease itself.

If I could access and control my pump, I could work around known
design flaws, such as incorrect calculations of insulin on board, as
well as better tailor my therapy to my lifestyle.

I've talked with the FDA about this, but they were unable to give me a
clear answer, since they never made an endorsement, and ignored my
questions.
