# Patient access to patient data

We've lost our patience.

## What do we want?

We want unrestricted access to our medical data, regardless of what it is called.  Devices such as insulin pumps, pacemakers, and ICDs generate and collect information about us.  However, we have no way to verify the behavior of operation of these devices, and thus we are prevented from using these devices to properly care for our health.  Industry initiatives have guaranteed that in the case of device malfunction, the patient is the last to know, if ever.  The binary logs, the historical records of our devices, are our property and we need access to them in order to stay safe.

## Audience

* FDA
* Congress
  * San Francisco: Nancy Pelosi

Your queries have been vetted through subject matter experts in the Center =
for Devices and Radiological Health, in addition to Mr. Watson. It has been=
 determined that your request for information may be best fulfilled through=
 CMS (Centers for Medicaid and Medicare
Services) , ONC (Health and Human Services Office of the National Coordinat=
or for Health Information Technology) and OS (Health and Human Services Off=
ice of the Secretary) who handles data issues relative to access, security =
and privacy, for FDA does not regulate
patient access to medical records.&nbsp; However, when the time arises your=
 inquiry may allow the FDA to express its opinion about the importance of p=
atient-centric care, which begins with patients having access to informatio=
n about themselves. Even though we are
not the driver for the specific area of patient data access, we can take ad=
vantage of the opportunity your inquiry has presented us to have the discus=
sion with our HHS counterparts.<br>

## Tactics
Are we sure CLIA would govern the data collected by device companies?
What is the process wrt the CLIA amendment- what is taking so damn long?  When did the HIPAA lawyer and Adrian start pressing the ONC to stop sitting on it?  And what was their response?
Are there certain legislators who are supporting the CLIA amendment and others who are against it?  Who is educated on the Washington insider view of this?  Who can we start letter campaigns to?  How can we get traction?
Query FDA, Office of Civil Rights, specifically because they enforce HIPAA) about Medtronic's role as a BA (business associate).

What is the procedure for this?  Whom do we write?  What should the request say?
